= Your Needed Tools =

Hey Isaac.  Danny and I want to know what the most important tools you may need for developing sites so we can prioritize accordingly.

Some tools to think about would be: 
 * Navigation controller
 * Template component 
 * Form controller
 * Basic MySQL authentication

{{{
$mysql> SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `clue` > 0;
no results found
}}}

If you can think of anything else let us know.  Thanks!
